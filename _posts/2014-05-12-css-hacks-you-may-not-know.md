Alright, This is a beginning. Actually, I should not say that this is a beginning, but this is more of a reincarnation of my first blog, which is still alive in Blogger.

**Why did I create this blog?**

This can be a question you might have, Why do you need this blog, when there are lots of social media platforms available?

Well, even though, I have accounts in most of them, including Medium where I write seldom, I wanted this blog to be a true reflection of myself. a place where I can share anything, write anything and even post anything.

**How did I create this blog?**

Using jekyll

**Whats Next?**

As a next step, I will be updating this blog everyday, and that the key goal here ðŸ‘». Donâ€™t fret, eventually, I will be sharing my learnings from my experience, whether that be how to create experiences for mobile games to what kind of aquarium filter you need to buy for your next tank. Yep, you are in for a treat ðŸ¤“

Cheerios.
