I’ve been trying to figure out a system which would allow me to optimise my works and improvise my self as a person.

As a step, I was looking at building two systems which would act as a:
1. Knowledge Repository
2. Productivity set up

Initially, I was trying to build a unified system, which would solve both of these issues. But as this would take lots of time, I thought of building these as two different systems which can be integrated on the go. 

## Knowledge Repository
I wanted to move away from Bear as a my notes repository, tried different softwares as a substitute, and then landed at Notion at the expense of loading time. 

As a starter, I cloned Thomas Frank’s note taking systems and used his Apple shortcuts recipe to overcome the loading time of Notion.

## Productivity Setup
I’ve been using Things3 as my todo list for more than 3 years now and its a shame to admit that I’ve been a failure in maintaining my tasks. 

To create an effective setup, I chose Todoist as my todo list organiser and Notion as my summary tool. As Notion is a *“do it all”* tool initially, I wanted to create the todo list set up inside notion itself. Eventually backed out of that, as I wanted calendar integrations and few gamification methods to keep me active on slaying my to-dos.

The system I build in notion helped me to 
1. Create a wrap up of daily tasks
2. Analyse Weekly events
3. Summing up monthly chores.
4. Create a yearly review.

### Next steps:
1. Create a Dashboard for my daily tasks
2. Create Linking between daily tasks-weekly-Monthly-Yearly Reviews
